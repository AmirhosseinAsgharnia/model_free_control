The controller is proposed for a nonlinear system in:

Karayiannidis, Y., Papageorgiou, D., & Doulgeri, Z. (2016). A model-free controller for guaranteed prescribed performance tracking of both robot joint positions and velocities. IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 1(1), 267-273.

I proved the boundedness of this controller under certain choice of parameters for a nonlinear inverted pendulum.

The controller controls \theta with the proposed controller, while \theta_d is used to control x (position of chart) through a PD controller.
